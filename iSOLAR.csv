TLE5046IC-PWM-R100,ATV_CHASSIS_ABS/BRAKING,,JAPAN,"From our design description:_x000D_
_x000D_
The algorithm used for direction detection exploits the systematic 90° phase shift between speed and direction paths obtained by a monocell and counteracts the susceptibility of the same GMR monocell to temperature drifts by special bias in case of small signals. Two direction detection modes are implemented:_x000D_
- Mono mode: for large signals, prevents signal distortion with large pitch_x000D_
- Pseudo differential mode: for small signals, increase stray field rejection and signal to noise ratio_x000D_
The selection of direction detection mode is done dynamically and the concept is therefore called “Hybrid”._x000D_
_x000D_
The extended pole wheel pitch range, in conjunction with large airgaps required in application, poses a serious challenge for direction detection._x000D_
The monocell approach is extremely sensitive to thermal drifts and GMR R0 drift over lifetime: the product performances can not be achieved for Bx<1mT where non-idealities dominate the signal behavior._x000D_
For this reason a hybrid concept is introduced: the ASIC can also bias the direction GMR with a current proportional to the current flowing in the whole bridge speed obtaining a pseudo differential behavior with suppression of common mode signals like stray fields and thermal drifts of R0._x000D_
_x000D_
The advantages are:_x000D_
- A differential behavior is generated, capable of suppressing stray fields and R0 drifts due to temperature/aging effect_x000D_
- The direction detection can also work with very low field as required by application_x000D_
_x000D_
The disadvantages are:_x000D_
- For large fields, the direction signal gets largely distorted and can create additional local minima with very small signal at speed zero crossing and impact on safety concept_x000D_
- The direction signal gets an amplitude reduction with increasing pole wheel pitches._x000D_
_x000D_
For the above considerations, the following hybrid approach is introduced:_x000D_
- Direction detection is by default set at pseudo differential mode after reset_x000D_
- Direction detection switches to monocell mode if speed signal exceeds a predetermined threshold or if mono mode is detected in valid microbreak_x000D_
- The pseudo differential mode can be restored by a signal watchdog",pseudo-diff to mono mode switch explanation,"Could you please help to explain the switching behavior from normal mode to mono mode?_x000D_

As discussed, with some rerouting of existing signals and using few spare parts (extra logic gates already available in the silicon), we managed to change the priority between standstill and warning pulse. Technically, this has been made according to the drawing of the pptx. If more details are needed do not hesitate to ask again.

TLE5046IC-PWME-R100,ATV_CHASSIS_ABS/BRAKING,,JAPAN,"[1] Check picture in page 2. When the wheel is moving, at each speed event the temperature is measured and the delta from the previous sample is calculated. If this delta is too big, then the temperature watchdog is triggered. When we are in standstill, at each standstill event the temperature is sampled and the delta from the last speed event is calculated (see the figure). If the delta is too big, then the temperature watchdog is triggered_x000D_
_x000D_
[2] At high temperature (T > 150°C), the offset drift due to temperature change is much bigger than in normal operating temperatures, hence the threshold on the deltaT is smaller for T > 150°C. For this reason we made this difference in the concept._x000D_

Could you please help to qularify the answer?_x000D_

[1]They understood IC monitors temperature change during standstill and if it excesses the the threshold, watchdog activates._x000D_
They have question that during normal operation, IC monitors temperatue change between 2 magnetic periodical signals and if sudden huge temperature change occurs during 2 signals, the watchdog activates?_x000D_
Or watchdog only activates during standstill mode?_x000D_

--> I recognize the answer is former._x000D_
    During normal operation, if such huge temperature change occurs, watchdog activates. But if temperature change is within threshold and next input signal comes, IC adjust the offset everytime._x000D_

[1]Please check ""PWM_Hysterisis1"" sheet._x000D_
This is my understanding._x000D_
The point is..._x000D_
_x000D_
#When IC detect more than 2 x dBlimit amplitude, the first output pulse comes._x000D_
#When calibration completes, zerocross point is fixed and also hysterisis is set (25% of full amplitude)_x000D_
#If the thermal noise excesses this hysterisis, the noise output pulse comes._x000D_
But infineon totally considered thermal noise effect and decided the spec of hysterisis(25%). Infineon thinks this hysterisis is sufficient to prevent wrong pulse due to thermal noise._x000D_
(This block diagram is exmaple, so I expresses the noise which excesses hysterisis.)_x000D_
#If rise edge excesses hysterisis, but fall edge doesn't excess hysterisis, only 1 pulse comes. Otherwise, 2 pulse come._x000D_
_x000D_
[2]Please check ""PWM_Hysterisis2"" sheet._x000D_
This chart expresses the situation what temperature watchdog activetes._x000D_
This is my understanding._x000D_
The point is... _x000D_
_x000D_
#If temperature change excesses threshold, the IC becomes uncalibrated mode again and search all input signal for full range._x000D_
#If temperature watchdog activates, the zerocross and hysterisis setting also disappears._x000D_
So after temperature watchdog happens, the hysterisis for thermal noise is equivalent with dBstartup(2xdBlimit)_x000D_
As  long as the noise excesses 2xdBlimit amplitude, there's no output due to thermal noise._x000D_

If this situation occurs, the IC can't enter normal mode permanently._x000D_
 So we should inform customer that they should supply at least 5.39V to consider such voltage drop if they use 50Ohm register._x000D_
_x000D_
[4]But above case is considering extremly worst case._x000D_
_x000D_
Vreset -> 3.5V (worst case)_x000D_
Vhys -> 1.7V (worst case)_x000D_
IError -> 3.8mA (Worst case)_x000D_
_x000D_
The probability that all worst case happens simultaneously is very low._x000D_
So 5.39V is very conservative value actually._x000D_
_x000D_
[Conclusion]_x000D_
But as long as there's small possibility,_x000D_
we should inform to customer to supply more than 5.39V to gurantee correct IC behavior._x000D_

question 1,2, & 3 can be answered together: _x000D_
_x000D_
An angle error can occur at all angles, also on 90°, 180°. Typically, one reason for an angle error is an Offset or Amplitude mismatch of the raw signals (sin / cos) .This results in a periodic angle error which affects the complete output range. _x000D_

TLE5046IC-PWME-R100,ATV_CHASSIS_ABS/BRAKING,,JAPAN,"The described case 3 is not a realistic case. _x000D_
We can have 60-40-60-40.... but not 60-60-40-40-60-60..._x000D_
For a good target wheel, where North and South poles have always the same length, the sum of a period must be 100 (40-60 or 60-40 for example, depending on the offset of the signal). You can have consecutive 60-60 (or 40-40) due to external phenomena (airgap jump for example) but just for two successive pulses, then again 40-60 is alternating: example 40-60-40-60-60-40-60-40-60..._x000D_
So the message for Denso is that we do not see realistic application scenarios where this phenomena (60-60-40-40...) is happening and if they calculate the speed based on the period length, then the calculated speed is right._x000D_
_x000D_
Update of the solution to make it more clear:  Either is 40-60-40-60-40-60... or 60-40-60-40-60-40... It can happen that due to an expected events it changes from 40-60 to 60-40 over a period but then this would affect only two consecutive pulses and have something like 40-60-40-60-60-40-60-40 or 60-40-60-40-40-60-40-60, but alternating of 40-60-60-40-40-60-60-40 is not possible (it would mean that either the offset of the signal jump from positive to negative for each magnetic period, or that the design of the target wheel is really bad/strange). So basically the calculated speed based on a whole magnetic period (60-40 or 40-60) is always correct and it could be deviated only for this one period where you have an unexpected situation like an airgap jump.",The duty spec related to speed accuracy ,"Simone, I discussed with Patricia last week, but I haven't became clear, and she is still business trip now, so could you please help to support this topic?_x000D_

_x000D_
Next, please check TLE5046-PWM's 3 cases._x000D_

Case1 and Case2 is no problem, but if we consider Case3, the there's maximum 20% error from original speed._x000D_
If the speed is fast, this 20% is not big impact, but if the speed is slow, this 20% affects not small. So Denso is worried about this point._x000D_
_x000D_
Denso asked whether TLE5046-PWM only occurs this visio's case2 only._x000D_
For this point, I recognize Patricia gave me comment that there's also possibility that case3 occurs._x000D_

The continuous direction toggling 0->1->0->1 is due to the fact that the difference between two consecutive direction samples is smaller than the 50% of the direction signal amplitude (which being filtered is still too big compared with the actual signal) and this is interpreted as a change of direction. We discussed this already, I attach the pptx we sent you that time._x000D_
_x000D_
2) The LM bits change according to the value of the differential magnetic field (see the attached picture taken from the application note). As for question 1, you should take into account that the speed signal amplitude is filtered and some magnetic events are needed to properly update the amplitude (this means, if the airgap suddenly changes, this is not immediately reflected in the LM bits). When the measured amplitude is bigger than one of the thresholds (proportional to dBlimit), then the LM bits are updated. Moreover, it should be taken into account that the field amplitude of magnetic encoder wheel changes exponentially with the airgap (and not linearly). So a change in the airgap of 1mm (just as an example) can have a different impact on the field (and hence on the LM bits) depending on the starting airgap and the ending airgap (see the Bx field graph of one of our target wheels as an example).",The TLE5046iC-AK-LR behavior by Kjump spec violation,"Hitachi is trying to verify the IC by using PGSISI kit._x000D_

So I would say that your explanation makes a lot of sense. I attach the pptx that explains the watchdog concepts, where also the signal watchdog is explained (moreover you can use the explanation in the App Note). You can use this to explain the concept to Hitachi, if you think it is important for them to understand. You can ""sell it"" as a good sensor feature that improve the safety concept (crosscheck of the direction and speed signals avoiding deadlock and stuck at states) and reset the chip to a known status in case of misbehavior.

■1_x000D_
Denso requires to provide the detail of our FE/BE test contents because they are considering their test method._x000D_
_x000D_
Previously you gave us the attachment for SWS._x000D_
But the table(p3) is for AK protocol products._x000D_
_x000D_
Is this table also same for PWM prptocol products?_x000D_
Or are there any different test for PWM one?_x000D_
If PWM product has additional test, could you please prepare same table for that?_x000D_
Otherwise, could you please remove ""AK-Protocol after detection"" and ""AK-Protocol bit length"" columns and give me the updated table?_x000D_
_x000D_
■2_x000D_
Next, they would like to know how to mesure for each item._x000D_
Is it possible to add supplemental explanation for each test items?_x000D_
_x000D_
(example)_x000D_
・Idd -> Supply voltage to IC and measure the current without IC power up._x000D_
・I_low/I_high/I_min -> add fixed stable magnetic input by coil and monitor the output current ampritude._x000D_
・I_Error -> To enter one of Error state (Low voltage ot something) and monitor the output current._x000D_
・DB_limit -> Not apply magnetic signal, To supply voltage and check the sensitivity and calculate the dB_limit._x000D_

TLE5046IC-PWME-R100,ATV_CHASSIS_ABS/BRAKING,,JAPAN,"I spoke with the technology expert Armin Satz. He explained me that the requirement (1m @85°C) were given by our lead customer Conti. The specification from Conti are related to the worst case condition in their magnetization process, which actually is not needed for TLE5045iC/46iC but is given as general specification for speed sensors (during assembly process similar situation can happen). So we measured only in that worst case condition and we passed the test -> no data is available right now for higher temperatures. _x000D_
_x000D_
We are not sure at the moment how much effort would be required from our side to repeat the measure but it seems not so easy (because the measurement were done on GMR samples and not IC sample and they were run in Munich, not in Villach). I attach the max-rating powerpoint report that can be useful for you as a reference. _x000D_
_x000D_
Because if Denso is worried about this happening in the application I would say this is not a critical topic and Denso could understand this without need of measurement results. I understand that the temperature can be higher than 85 degree in the application, but the sensor would never see a high field capable to damage it. Even for very small airgaps (0.35 mm) the field is not greater than 50/60mT (check the attachment as a reference, this refers to out target wheel JT65 #55). Moreover, with high temperatures the magnetic field of the wheel becomes weaker. Assuming -0.2%/K, at highest temperature of 190 degree the field would be less than 40mT. This is the saturation range of our GMRs and I do not see it as a critical value that could compromize their behavior permanently. _x000D_
In case of assembly process this depend on the step Denso is doing, but since there is no need of magnetization step we do not expect that they can apply such a high field together with high temperature._x000D_
_x000D_
Regarding Bx and Bz, it depends on the design of the magnetic encoder, but as a rule of thumb you can assume that the amplitudes of Bx and Bz are comparable, while By is much smaller (for y=0 and no tilting)._x000D_

TLE5046IC-PWME-R100,ATV_CHASSIS_ABS/BRAKING,,JAPAN,"The magnetic operating range (-25mT to 25mT) is not temperature dependent and it is valid in all the temperature range. _x000D_
In the datasheet it is written that the test was performed at 25°C just because the magnetic encoder magnetic field is temperature dependent and if we would repeat the test for different temperatures we should continuously adjust the airgap to get the same field amplitude (this is not practical). So the important values of these specifications are -25mT / 25mT, valid in all the temperature range.
